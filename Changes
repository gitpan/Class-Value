    - converted the distribution to Dist::Zilla-style

0.07 Thu 2009.11.05 15:41:49 CET (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - Class::Value::Test sets $Class::Value::SkipChecks = 0 because in tests
       you'll most likely want to test exceptions and such
     - miscellaneous performance tuning

0.06  Mon Oct 20 17:38:57 CEST 2008 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - Changed dist style and Changes back to standard. People didn't like it -
       the nail that sticks out gets hammered down.
     - Added standard test files; this will also help with CPANTS.
     - added META.yml to svn:ignore
     - value object is does not support dirty flag; that took too much time. If
       needed, subclass and use constructor_with_dirty
     - default for SkipChecks is now 1
